function Even(collection){

var hashtable = {};
hashtable['screaming'] = ["red","orange"];
hashtable['mellow'] = ["skyblue","yellow","green"];
you can also set and access values in an object using dot notation:

hashtable.screaming = ["red","orange"];
alert(hashtable.screaming[0]);


	//for each number i would need a x number of occurrences in the collectionand the first index of them
	//return the value with (number of ocurrences % 2 = 0) that has the smallest index
	//return the value with even occurrences with the smallest index
}
